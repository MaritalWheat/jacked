Jacked
*******
description:

    Crank, minus Jason Statham, plus one confused little boy in a forest full of horrors.  Twin-stick top down 2D action,
    designed to always push players towards that fine knife's edge point of being extremely powerful and not being able
    to be in control - ideally, Jacked is a car pushing its top speed almost all the time.  RPG-lite elements,
    i.e. leveling/skill/weapons systems, in development.

*******
background:

    Global Game Jam '13 game, with continued development.  Core base developed at GGJ, including AI, animation system,
    game manager, general UI flow.  Post-jam development has focused on implementing final UI, developing skill and 
    weapons systems, finalizing game flow, and cleaning up game jam work (that in itself is...a task).
    
    Content creation is next big phase.  
    
    Desperately in need of an artist!
*******
todo:
    
    -re-work AI
    -add enemy types
    -rework physics / collisions - wait for 2D tools?
    -camera bounding
    -make animation system more robust, improve animation workflow - wait for 2D tools?
    -weapons/skills - content
